# Social Network Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a social network using networkx, a Python library for network analysis. The dataset is provided in `connections.txt`, representing connections between nodes in the network.

## Files
- **README.md:** The main documentation file providing an overview of the project, its structure, and key details.
- **Social Network Analysis Homework.pdf:** The assignment or guidelines for the social network analysis homework.
- **connections.txt:** The dataset containing information about connections between nodes in the social network.
- **main.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for data analysis, network visualization, and community detection.
- **requirements.txt:** A file specifying the required Python packages and versions for reproducing the project environment.

## Project Structure
- The analysis is performed in `main.ipynb`, where various aspects of the social network are explored, including graph creation, identification of influential nodes, community detection, and marketing strategy recommendations.
- The project leverages networkx, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- The recommendations for a hypothetical business based on network analysis insights are detailed in the notebook.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies by installing them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` to explore the social network analysis and view the recommendations.
3. Review the README for additional information on the project and its structure.

Feel free to customize and extend the analysis based on specific requirements or use cases.
